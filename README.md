## About Elephluent

Elephluent is a simple and easy to use app to help people learn. The flashcards can be customized and the UI is very simple. 

## Getting Started

[Intial Design](https://trello.com/b/I7iNtudy/mind-palace)


Elephluent uses Trunks (decks) and Tusks (Flashcards) to help you learn. When you sign up you'll be taken to a page where you can create your first Trunk. Choose any topic you would like.

Once you add a Trunk it is time to start adding Tusks to the Trunk. 

After you've built your first Trunk head over to the practice area and start reviewing. 

## Next Steps
1. Adding sound effects.
2. Tracking the number of days in a row a user has used the app.
3. Creating a leaderboard for the most days in a row a user has used the app.
4. Integrating the Webster Dictionary API.
5. Making the board a component instead of seperate page.
6. Creating a search function.
